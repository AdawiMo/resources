# Services by region
{: #services_region}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} makes it easy for you to implement, host, and scale services and apps. You can focus on your application logic and application design.
{:shortdesc}

Not all services are available for purchase in every {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region. And, even if the service is available to purchase in that region, the service might be hosted in a different location. The following table shows the services that are provided by IBM.

Services that are hosted globally create resources that operate across multiple regions. For example, with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (COS), you can choose to disperse data across a single data center, an entire region, or even a combination of regions by [selecting the endpoint](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics/endpoints.html#select-regions-and-endpoints) where your application sends REST API requests.

<!-- Do not manually change the table or add content after the table. -->
<!-- Everything after the second line of the table will be deleted. -->
<!-- Also, do not change the number of dashes in the second line. -->
<!-- Ping @natimpe for details. -->
